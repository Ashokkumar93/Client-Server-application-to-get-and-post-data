# Client-Server-application-to-get-and-post-data


      I created a simple server and client communication application. In this project, I developed    
      one server application and serverClientThread, client applications. in this server side 
      program, I am giving port number to communicate from client side user. Here, we are 
      sending files to the server and getting(downloading) files from the server.
